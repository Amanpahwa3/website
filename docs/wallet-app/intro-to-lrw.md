The Libra Reference Wallet is meant to be a demonstration of how a wallet will work on the Libra Blockchain. You can use this wallet to test and understand the concepts behind wallet development on the Libra network. The goal of the reference wallet project is to help you determine how to implement, customize, and integrate your wallet on the Libra network.



### The lifecycle of a transaction

Before you get started with the Libra Reference Wallet, get familiar with how transactions are sent and received on the blockchain. 

When you submit a transaction to the network, you are cryptographically signing a transaction script and then waiting (by listening to the event stream) for consensus from validators. The diagram below shows the flow of a transaction once itâ€™s been submitted. Learn more about this flow [here](https://developers.libra.org/docs/life-of-a-transaction).
