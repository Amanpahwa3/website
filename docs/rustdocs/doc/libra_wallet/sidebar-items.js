Note that this Wallet does not promote security as the mnemonic is stored in unencrypted form. In future iterations, we will be realesing more robust Wallet implementations. It is our intention to present a foundation that is simple to understand and incrementally improve the LibraWallet implementation and it's security guarantees throughout testnet. For a more robust wallet reference, the authors suggest to audit the file of the same name in the rust-wallet crate. That file can be found here:"]]});
