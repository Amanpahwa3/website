  "description": "The [Libra Blockchain](https://developers.libra.org/docs/the-libra-blockchain-paper) is powered by open-source software. The first implementation of the Libra protocol — the technology behind the blockchain — is Libra Core, which is an [open-source project](https://github.com/libra/libra) managed by the [Libra Association](https://libra.org/en-us/association-council-principles) using development practices established by the open-source community. Developing the technology behind the Libra Blockchain in this way ensures that the blockchain is accessible to everyone and that technology decisions are fair and transparent.",
