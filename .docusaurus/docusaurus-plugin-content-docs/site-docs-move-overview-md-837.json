  "description": "Move is a new programming language developed to provide a safe and programmable foundation for the Libra Blockchain. An account in the Libra Blockchain is a container for an arbitrary number of Move resources and Move modules. Every transaction submitted to the Libra Blockchain uses a transaction script written in Move to encode its logic. The transaction script can call procedures declared by a module to update the global state of the blockchain.",
