  "description": "`libra-swarm` is used to start a local network of validator nodes and a local blockchain on your computer. Running a local network makes it easier to test and debug your code changes. To view the logs generated by your local nodes, use the instructions in [How Do I Access The Logs?](#how-do-i-access-the-logs) You can use the CLI command `dev` to compile, publish, and execute Move Intermediate Representation (IR) programs on your local cluster of nodes. Refer to [Run Move Programs Locally](run-move-locally.md) for further details.",
